# ❄️ Fridge Energy Dashboard

An interactive data visualization project that analyzes energy consumption patterns of a household refrigerator. Built using real-world time-series data, the dashboard provides actionable insights to optimize energy usage, detect anomalies, and promote sustainable energy habits.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🕒 Time-series analysis of fridge energy usage over days, hours, and conditions  
- 📊 Built a fully interactive dashboard using **Tableau** (or replace with Power BI/Plotly if you used another tool)  
- ⚡ Identified **peak usage patterns**, **standby power loss**, and **cooling cycle behavior**  
- 🧠 Gained insights into energy efficiency and usage optimization  
- 💡 Encourages behavior change through visual storytelling and data-driven recommendations

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Household refrigerators run 24/7, often unnoticed as major contributors to electricity bills. This project aims to understand how a single appliance — the fridge — consumes energy throughout the day, and how informed decisions can reduce wastage and improve efficiency.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: IoT-enabled smart plug energy data  
- **Frequency**: Per minute/hour readings  
- **Fields**: Timestamp, Power Consumption (Watts), Voltage, Current  
- **Size**: ~30 days of data, ~40,000 rows
